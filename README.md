# Overview  
This repository is actually a report made for "Data analysis and visualization" laboratories. It contains various plots and scripts + data to generate them. All of them were created using Python's *matplotlib* library. Some scripts may differ by only one line of code, as it was a requirement to have seperate scripts for each plot. The quality of the code was not a priority in this project. The report can be found in the *report4_5.pdf* file.  
   

Python files must be run with one additional argument, 0 or 1. For example: 'python 2a.py 1'.  
0 - show plot  
1 - save plot
